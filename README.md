# ngx-d3-tooltip

Add tooltips to your d3 visualizations using Angular Components.

## Why?

D3.js is a great visualization library, but building dynamic tooltips is a bit clunky. Angular is an app framework and has great html templating and data-binding, which are features that are ideal for tooltips. This project aims to achieve the best of both worlds.
